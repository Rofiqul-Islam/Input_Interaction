			<h2>About this app</h2>
			<h3>Instructions for using the app</h3>
				<p> <b>One Button:</b> The application starts automatically when it is loaded. Each button is selected at 1 second time interval.
				To select a specific button on the calculator, user needs to use 's' key on the keyboard.</p>
				<p> <b>Two Button: </b> User can also go to next button using key "n" and select specific button using key "s" on keyboard if he/she does not want to wait for 1 second time interval.
				<h3>Test Description</h3>
				<p>The application has been tested with three versions:
				<li> Navigation using two keys, one for moving to next button, another for selecting the button.[ 'n' for movement', 's' for selection ] </li>
				<li> Navigation using one key, continuous selection of row after 3 seconds of interval. </li>
				<li> Navigation using one key, continuous selection of row after 1 second of interval. </li>
				</p>
				<p> User was given five equations : "10 * 5 + 30 ", 855 / 55 - 3*15", "6 * 12 + 12 - 6", "8 * 45 * 25 + 28 - 3", "7 * 45 /25 + 26 + 10", 100 * 25 - 25*25 +500/100 .
				User was tested on four trials for each version: hand, using back of the hand, using forearms, using foot
-				</p>
			<h3>Test Result</h3>
			<p>User has made errors in all trials had to start over for completing the test. On average, more errors were made when using forearms
				and foot, than when using hand or back of hand. When using two keys, user found difficulty as the keys were very far apart from each
				other on the keyboard, and thus	took more time to complete with foot and forearms. One user made 5-6 errors in those versions. In the other two versions, the user took around 3 minutes
			to complete each equation, and made 1-3 errors. However, the version with 3 seconds navigation interval caused more time delay for user and made him disappointed of waiting too much. 				
			Overall, the user found the version with one key and 1 second span as the most satisfying.</p>
